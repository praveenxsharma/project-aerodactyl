# Project Aerodactyl

Project Aerodactyl is a release hub for custom ROM builds targeting the Nothing Phone 2a and Nothing Phone 2a Plus. It is designed to present current ROM versions, source-side changes, builder notes, and per-ROM release tracking in a clean layout that works well on both desktop and mobile.

Live site: `https://project-aerodactyl.netlify.app`

GitHub: `https://github.com/TwistedVision518/project-aerodactyl`

## Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS with custom motion and scene effects
- Netlify for hosting

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Run lint checks:

```bash
pnpm exec eslint .
```

## Content Editing

Most of the site content lives in:

`src/data/siteContent.ts`

That file controls:

- ROM names, versions, statuses, and device targets
- Source Pulse entries
- Builder Notes entries
- Device coverage cards
- Expansion / workflow cards

If you want live release buttons, update the `telegramUrl` values in `src/data/siteContent.ts` with the correct Telegram post links for each ROM.

## Deployment

The site is already connected to Netlify and can be redeployed from this project directory.

Manual production deploy:

```bash
pnpm --package=netlify-cli dlx netlify deploy --prod
```

Netlify project:

## Notes

- The layout is organized per ROM to avoid mixing release context across different builds.
- Mobile performance is prioritized by reducing heavier pointer effects on coarse/touch devices.
- The visual system uses a near-AMOLED black base with animated color fields layered behind the content.
